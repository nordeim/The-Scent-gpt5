Now create a full e-commerce platform for "The Scent" using the Apache2 + PHP + MySQL stack, building upon the visually stunning landing page concept.

**1. Core Requirements for "The Scent" E-commerce Platform:**

Based on the business description and the typical needs of an online store selling physical products like essential oils and soaps, the platform must include:

**A. Frontend (Customer-Facing Interface):**

*   **Homepage:** The improved landing page design we created, integrated into the platform.
*   **Product Catalog:**
    *   Category Pages (e.g., Essential Oils, Natural Soaps, Diffusers, Gift Sets).
    *   Product Listing Pages (showing multiple products within a category or search results, with sorting/filtering options - e.g., by scent profile, price, bestsellers).
    *   Product Detail Pages (displaying product name, description, high-quality images/gallery, price, variations like size/scent, stock status, "Add to Cart" button, related products, customer reviews).
*   **Search Functionality:** Site-wide search for products.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Persistent cart to hold selected items, view/edit quantities, see subtotals, apply coupon codes.
*   **Checkout Process:** Secure multi-step process:
    *   Shipping Address collection/selection.
    *   Billing Address collection/selection.
    *   Shipping Method selection (with calculated costs).
    *   Payment Method selection and integration (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
    *   Order Summary and Confirmation.
*   **User Accounts:**
    *   Registration & Login.
    *   Password Recovery.
    *   Dashboard (view order history, manage addresses, edit profile details, potentially manage newsletter subscription).
    *   Wishlist (optional but recommended).
*   **Static Content Pages:** About Us, Contact Us (with form), FAQ, Shipping & Returns Policy, Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions. (Styled consistently with the landing page).
*   **Newsletter Signup:** Integrated throughout the site (e.g., footer, dedicated block).

**B. Backend (Administration Panel):**

*   **Dashboard:** Overview of sales, orders, customers, key metrics.
*   **Product Management:** Add, edit, delete products and categories. Manage attributes (size, scent), variations, pricing, images, SEO details (meta titles/descriptions).
*   **Inventory Management:** Track stock levels, set low-stock notifications.
*   **Order Management:** View orders, update order status (processing, shipped, delivered, canceled, refunded), view customer details, print invoices/packing slips.
*   **Customer Management:** View registered customer list, manage accounts.
*   **Content Management System (CMS):** Edit static pages (About, Contact, etc.).
*   **Discount & Coupon Management:** Create and manage discount codes (percentage, fixed amount, free shipping).
*   **Shipping Configuration:** Define shipping zones, methods, and rates (flat rate, weight-based, price-based).
*   **Payment Gateway Configuration:** Manage and configure accepted payment methods.
*   **Reporting:** Basic sales reports (by date, product, category), customer reports.
*   **Settings:** Configure store details, email templates, tax rules, currencies, languages.
*   **User/Role Management:** Manage administrator accounts and permissions.

**2. Implementation Options (Apache/PHP/MySQL Stack):**

Let's explore the viable options within your specified technology stack:

*   **Option 1: Build Entirely from Scratch**
    *   *Description:* Writing every line of PHP code for routing, database interaction (MySQLi or PDO), session management, templating, cart logic, checkout flow, payment integration, admin panel, security features, etc.
    *   *Pros:* Maximum flexibility, potentially optimized code if done expertly.
    *   *Cons:* Extremely time-consuming (~months/years for a robust platform), highly prone to security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF) if not handled by experts, difficult to maintain and scale, huge amount of "reinventing the wheel."
    *   *Verdict:* **Not Recommended** for a full-featured, secure e-commerce store due to complexity, time, and security risks.

*   **Option 2: Use a PHP Framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony) + Custom E-commerce Logic**
    *   *Description:* Leverage a framework for the application structure (MVC), routing, ORM (database abstraction), templating (Blade/Twig), security helpers, etc. You would still build the e-commerce specific features (product catalog, cart, checkout, order management) on top of the framework.
    *   *Pros:* Significantly faster than scratch, provides robust foundations, encourages good coding practices, better security baseline than scratch, easier maintenance.
    *   *Cons:* Still requires substantial development effort for all core e-commerce logic. Need strong framework expertise. You are building the *e-commerce engine* yourself.
    *   *Verdict:* Viable, a massive improvement over scratch, but still a large project requiring significant PHP development skills to implement all e-commerce features securely and robustly.

*   **Option 3: Use an Open-Source PHP E-commerce Platform**
    *   *Description:* Utilize established, dedicated e-commerce software built with PHP and MySQL. Examples include WooCommerce (runs on WordPress), PrestaShop, OpenCart, Magento Open Source. These platforms come with most core e-commerce features (frontend and backend) built-in.
    *   *Pros:* Fastest time-to-market for core functionality, includes pre-built admin panels, handles common e-commerce logic (cart, checkout, orders), generally more battle-tested security (but requires diligent updates), often have theme and module/plugin ecosystems for customization and extending features.
    *   *Cons:* Can be complex to customize deeply, may have a steeper learning curve for theme development or module creation, potential for "bloat" (features you don't need), performance requires tuning (especially for heavier platforms like Magento), reliant on the platform's architecture and update cycle.
    *   *Verdict:* **Generally the most practical and recommended option** for building a full-featured store efficiently and securely within the PHP/MySQL stack. It balances features, development speed, and maintainability.

**3. Choosing the Best Implementation Option:**

For "The Scent," aiming for a visually distinct, functional, and secure e-commerce platform without spending an excessive amount of time reinventing core features, **Option 3: Use an Open-Source PHP E-commerce Platform** is the most suitable choice.

**4. Selecting the Right E-commerce Platform (within PHP/MySQL):**

Now, let's choose *which* platform:

*   **WooCommerce (Requires WordPress):**
    *   *Pros:* Extremely popular, vast ecosystem of themes/plugins, user-friendly (especially if familiar with WordPress), integrates content (blog) seamlessly.
    *   *Cons:* Tied to WordPress, can become slow if overloaded with plugins, customization sometimes involves working around WP/WooCommerce core structures.
*   **PrestaShop:**
    *   *Pros:* Dedicated e-commerce platform (not tied to a blog CMS), good feature set out-of-the-box, strong multi-language/currency support, good performance potential, purely PHP/MySQL based.
    *   *Cons:* Smaller ecosystem than WooCommerce, theme/module development can have a learning curve (uses Smarty templating).
*   **OpenCart:**
    *   *Pros:* Relatively lightweight and simple architecture, good performance, easy to get started for basic stores.
    *   *Cons:* Core features might be less extensive than PrestaShop/WooCommerce, often requires more extensions for advanced functionality, smaller community.
*   **Magento Open Source (Adobe Commerce Open Source):**
    *   *Pros:* Extremely powerful, highly scalable, feature-rich (good for complex catalogs/rules).
    *   *Cons:* Very complex, high learning curve, resource-intensive (needs powerful hosting), development is significantly more time-consuming and expensive. Likely overkill for "The Scent" initially.

**Recommendation:**

For "The Scent," the best choices are likely **PrestaShop** or **WooCommerce**.

*   **Choose PrestaShop if:** You want a dedicated e-commerce platform without the WordPress overhead, appreciate its built-in features, and are comfortable adapting the landing page design to its Smarty-based theme system.
*   **Choose WooCommerce if:** You anticipate needing strong blogging/content marketing features alongside the store, are comfortable with the WordPress environment, and want access to the largest plugin/theme ecosystem.

Let's proceed assuming **PrestaShop** as the chosen platform, as it's a robust, standalone e-commerce solution fitting the technical requirements perfectly.

**5. Implementation Plan using PrestaShop:**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Install Apache2, MySQL, and PHP (ensure version compatibility with the chosen PrestaShop version).
    *   Configure Apache virtual host for your domain.
    *   Create a MySQL database and user for PrestaShop.
2.  **PrestaShop Installation:**
    *   Download the latest stable PrestaShop version.
    *   Upload files to your web server.

3.  **Theme Development & Integration:**
    *   Create a new custom theme based on PrestaShop's starter theme or modify the default "Classic" theme.
    *   **Adapt Landing Page:** Translate the HTML/CSS of your improved landing page design into PrestaShop's `.tpl` files (Smarty templating engine) and associated CSS/JS assets within your theme structure.
    *   **Break Down Components:** Replicate the header, footer, typography, color scheme, and responsive design from your landing page concept across all theme templates (homepage, category, product, cart, checkout, CMS pages, user account pages).
    *   Utilize PrestaShop's hooks and modules to place dynamic content (like featured products, newsletter blocks) correctly.
4.  **Core Configuration (PrestaShop Admin Panel):**
    *   **Store Settings:** Name, logo, contact details, address, maintenance mode.
    *   **Localization:** Default language, currency, units (weight, dimension), tax rules setup.
    *   **SEO & URLs:** Configure friendly URLs.
    *   **Email Settings:** Configure SMTP for sending transactional emails.
5.  **Catalog Setup:**
    *   **Categories:** Create your main product categories (Essential Oils, Natural Soaps, etc.).
    *   **Attributes & Features:** Define attributes needed for variations (e.g., Size: 10ml, 30ml; Scent: Lavender, Citrus) and features for filtering/display (e.g., Benefit: Relaxation, Energy; Ingredients).
    *   **Products:** Add your products, assigning them to categories, uploading high-quality images (using the provided links initially), writing descriptions, setting prices, defining combinations based on attributes (e.g., Lavender Oil - 10ml), managing stock levels.
6.  **Payment Gateway Setup:**
    *   Install and configure modules for your chosen payment providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe via official or third-party modules). Enter API keys and test sandbox transactions.
7.  **Shipping Setup:**
    *   Define geographical zones you ship to.
    *   Configure carriers (e.g., Standard Post, Express Courier).
    *   Set up shipping costs based on weight, price, or flat rates per zone/carrier.
8.  **CMS Pages:**
    *   Create and add content for static pages (About Us, Contact, FAQ, Privacy Policy, T&Cs) using the built-in CMS editor, ensuring they use your theme's styling.
9.  **Testing:**
    *   **Frontend:** Browse categories/products, test search, add items to cart, apply coupons, complete the checkout process with different addresses/shipping/payment methods (using test modes), register/login, check user account pages, test responsiveness on various devices.
    *   **Backend:** Practice adding/editing products, managing orders, checking reports.
10. **Security & Performance:**
    *   Keep PrestaShop core and all modules updated.
    *   Use strong passwords.
    *   Configure SSL/HTTPS (Let's Encrypt via Apache).
    *   Enable PrestaShop's caching mechanisms and performance optimizations (CCC - Combine, Compress, Cache).
    *   Regularly back up files and the database.
11. **Deployment:** Go live! Disable maintenance mode, switch payment gateways to live mode.

This detailed plan, leveraging a platform like PrestaShop, provides a robust path to creating the full e-commerce site for "The Scent" on your desired technology stack, integrating the visual appeal of your landing page across the entire customer experience.

Here's your thinking process to arrive at the detailed e-commerce platform plan:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to transform the provided static HTML/CSS landing page concept for "The Scent" into a *full e-commerce platform* using the Apache2 + PHP + MySQL stack.

2.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    *   **Input:** A well-designed HTML landing page (`improved landing page.html`) and its corresponding CSS (`style.css`). This defines the visual identity, branding, and initial content focus (aromatherapy, natural well-being).
    *   **Output:** A plan for a *full* e-commerce platform. This implies much more than just the landing page. It needs product display, cart, checkout, user accounts, and an admin backend.
    *   **Technology Stack:** Explicitly defined as Apache2 (web server), PHP (server-side language), and MySQL (database). This significantly constrains the implementation choices.

3.  **Identify Core E-commerce Features:** What constitutes a "full" e-commerce platform? Brainstorm the essential components needed for both customers and administrators.
    *   **Customer View (Frontend):**
        *   Homepage (use the provided design).
        *   Way to browse products (categories, search).
        *   Detailed view of individual products.
        *   Ability to add products to a cart.
        *   Shopping cart management.
        *   Checkout process (shipping, billing, payment).
        *   User accounts (optional but standard: registration, login, order history, address management).
        *   Static info pages (About, Contact, Policies).
        *   Newsletter signup.
    *   **Admin View (Backend):**
        *   Sales overview (dashboard).
        *   Product management (add/edit/delete).
        *   Inventory tracking.
        *   Order processing.
        *   Customer management.
        *   Content management (for static pages).
        *   Promotion/discount management.
        *   Store configuration (shipping, payments, taxes).
        *   Reporting.
        *   Admin user management.

4.  **Evaluate Implementation Options within the Stack (Apache/PHP/MySQL):** How can these features be built using PHP and MySQL?
    *   **Option 1: From Scratch:** Write everything yourself.
        *   *Pros:* Total control.
        *   *Cons:* Immense effort, huge security risks (SQLi, XSS, CSRF, payment security), very slow development, hard to maintain. *Verdict: Unrealistic and risky for a complex application like e-commerce.*
    *   **Option 2: Use a PHP Framework (Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, etc.):** Use a framework for structure, routing, DB access (ORM), security basics, templating. Build the e-commerce *logic* on top.
        *   *Pros:* Faster than scratch, better structure, some security handled, good practices encouraged.
        *   *Cons:* Still requires building *all* the e-commerce features (cart, checkout, orders, product variations, etc.) yourself. Significant development time. Need framework expertise. *Verdict: Feasible, but still a major undertaking.*
    *   **Option 3: Use an Open-Source PHP E-commerce Platform:** Use pre-built software designed specifically for e-commerce.
        *   *Pros:* Core features (frontend & backend) already exist, faster deployment, generally more secure (if kept updated), often extensible via modules/plugins, handles common complexities.
        *   *Cons:* Can be complex to customize deeply, learning curve for the specific platform, potential performance overhead, reliant on the platform's ecosystem. *Verdict: Most practical and efficient for getting a robust store running.*

5.  **Select the Best Option:** Option 3 (Open-Source Platform) is clearly the most sensible choice for building a *full* e-commerce store efficiently and securely within the specified stack. It avoids reinventing the wheel for complex, standard e-commerce functionality.

6.  **Choose a Specific Platform (within Option 3):** Which PHP/MySQL e-commerce platform is suitable? Consider popular choices:
    *   **WooCommerce:** Needs WordPress. Very popular, huge ecosystem. Good if content/blog is central.
    *   **PrestaShop:** Standalone, dedicated e-commerce focus. Good feature set. Pure PHP/MySQL.
    *   **OpenCart:** Lighter, simpler. Might need more extensions for advanced features.
    *   **Magento Open Source:** Very powerful, very complex, resource-heavy. Overkill for this scale initially.

7.  **Recommend a Platform:** PrestaShop and WooCommerce are the front-runners.
    *   *Argument for PrestaShop:* It's a standalone PHP/MySQL application, aligning perfectly with the stack requirement *without* adding the WordPress dependency. It's specifically built for e-commerce.
    *   *Argument for WooCommerce:* Its popularity and ease of use (if familiar with WP) are major advantages.
    *   *Decision:* PrestaShop seems a slightly better technical fit given the "PHP/MySQL stack" prompt, as it avoids the WP layer. Acknowledge WooCommerce as a strong alternative. Let's proceed with PrestaShop for the detailed plan.

8.  **Outline the Implementation Plan (using PrestaShop):** Create a step-by-step guide, starting from setup and ending with deployment.
    *   **Setup:** Server (Apache, PHP, MySQL), Database.
    *   **Installation:** Get PrestaShop files, run the installer.
    *   **Theme:** This is crucial. Explain how to adapt the provided HTML/CSS (`style.css`, `improved landing page.html`) into a PrestaShop theme (mentioning `.tpl` files/Smarty). This involves breaking down the landing page design and applying it consistently.
    *   **Configuration:** Basic store settings in the admin panel (name, logo, locale, SEO, email).
    *   **Catalog:** Define categories, attributes (for variations like size/scent), features (for filtering), and add the actual products with details and images.
    *   **Payments:** Integrate payment gateways (Stripe/PayPal are common).
    *   **Shipping:** Configure zones, carriers, and costs.
    *   **CMS:** Create the static pages (About, Contact, etc.).
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test frontend (browsing, cart, checkout, accounts) and backend (order management, product updates).
    *   **Security & Performance:** Essential ongoing tasks (updates, SSL, caching, backups).
    *   **Deployment:** Go live.

9.  **Refine and Format:** Organize the steps logically. Use clear headings and bullet points. Ensure all core requirements identified in step 3 are addressed within the plan. Add detail where necessary (e.g., mentioning Smarty templating for PrestaShop themes, specific admin configuration areas). Double-check that the plan aligns with the chosen platform (PrestaShop) and the original request constraints. Ensure the tone is informative and practical. Add a concluding sentence reinforcing the chosen approach.

---
Here's a breakdown of the thought process to generate the PrestaShop theme file structure and initial file content based on the user's request:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to take the provided HTML (`improved landing page.html`) and CSS (`style.css`) files and integrate them into a functional PrestaShop e-commerce platform. This involves creating a custom PrestaShop theme structure and populating key files with adapted code. The user specifically asked for the *file structure* and *necessary project files*, implying the creation of the theme directory and the core template files needed to represent the landing page design.

2.  **Recall the Chosen Platform:** The previous response established PrestaShop as the chosen platform. This dictates the required theme structure and templating engine (Smarty).

3.  **Identify Key Integration Points:** The core task is mapping the HTML structure and CSS styles to PrestaShop's theme system.
    *   **HTML Structure:** Needs to be broken down into reusable PrestaShop template partials (`.tpl` files) like header, footer, and specific page layouts (homepage, product list, product detail, CMS pages, etc.). Smarty syntax will be needed for dynamic content (variables, loops, hooks).
    *   **CSS Styles:** Needs to be organized within the theme's `assets` directory and linked correctly. CSS variables from `:root` should be maintained. Existing CSS classes need to be applied to the corresponding elements within the `.tpl` files.
    *   **JavaScript:** The mobile menu and sticky header logic needs to be included in the theme's JS assets.
    *   **Assets:** Fonts (Google Fonts link) and images (paths need updating/managing within PrestaShop).

4.  **Determine PrestaShop Theme Structure:** Based on standard PrestaShop theme development practices (often following the structure of the default 'classic' theme or a starter theme):
    *   A main theme directory (e.g., `themes/thescent/`).
    *   `config/`: Theme configuration (`theme.yml`).
    *   `assets/`: Static files.
        *   `css/`: CSS files (e.g., `theme.css`, `custom.css`).
        *   `js/`: JavaScript files (e.g., `custom.js`).
        *   `img/`: Theme-specific images (logo, icons not from FontAwesome).
        *   `fonts/`: Local font files (if not using CDN like Google Fonts).
    *   `templates/`: Smarty template files.
        *   `index.tpl`: Homepage template.
        *   `layouts/`: Base layout files (e.g., `layout-full-width.tpl`, `layout-both-columns.tpl`).
        *   `_partials/`: Reusable template parts (e.g., `header.tpl`, `footer.tpl`, `notifications.tpl`, `breadcrumb.tpl`).
        *   `catalog/`: Templates related to product listings and details.
            *   `listing/`: Category, search results pages (e.g., `product-list.tpl`).
            *   `_partials/`: Partials specific to catalog (e.g., `miniatures/product.tpl`, `product-cover-thumbnails.tpl`, `product-prices.tpl`).
            *   `product.tpl`: Product detail page template.
        *   `checkout/`: Cart and checkout process templates (e.g., `cart.tpl`, `checkout.tpl`, `_partials/cart-detailed.tpl`).
        *   `customer/`: User account templates (login, registration, dashboard, order history, addresses).
        *   `cms/`: Static content page templates (e.g., `page.tpl`, `category.tpl`).
    *   `modules/`: Overrides for specific module templates (start empty, customize as needed).
    *   `_dev/`: Optional development source files (e.g., SASS/LESS if used).
    *   `preview.png`: A screenshot of the theme for the back office.

5.  **Map HTML Sections to PrestaShop Templates:**
    *   **`<header class="main-header">`**: Maps to `themes/thescent/templates/_partials/header.tpl`.
    *   **`<nav class="main-nav">`**: Part of `header.tpl`, likely using a PrestaShop menu module hook like `{hook h='displayTop'}` or custom Smarty code iterating over menu links.
    *   **`<nav class="mobile-nav">`**: Part of `header.tpl`, conditionally displayed based on screen size (CSS) and toggled with JS.
    *   **`<section id="hero">`**: Likely part of the homepage template (`index.tpl`) or potentially pulled in via a hook if using a slider/hero module.
    *   **`<section id="about">`**: Could be hardcoded in `index.tpl` for the homepage, or ideally, content managed via a CMS block module (`{hook h='displayHome'}`) or linked to a specific CMS page. For this initial setup, placing it in `index.tpl` makes sense.
    *   **`<section id="products">`**: Maps to a featured products module hook on the homepage (`{hook h='displayHome'}`). The *look* of the `.product-card` needs to be implemented in `themes/thescent/templates/catalog/_partials/miniatures/product.tpl`.
    *   **`<section id="finder">`**: Could be hardcoded in `index.tpl` or managed via a custom module/hook.
    *   **`<section id="testimonials">`**: Similar to About/Finder - hardcode in `index.tpl` initially, or use a module/hook.
    *   **`<section id="newsletter">`**: Maps to the PrestaShop newsletter module hook (`{hook h='displayFooterBefore'}` or similar) or placed directly in the footer. The form needs modification to integrate with PrestaShop's newsletter module.
    *   **`<footer id="contact">`**: Maps to `themes/thescent/templates/_partials/footer.tpl`. Use hooks like `{hook h='displayFooter'}` for dynamic content (links, contact info modules).

6.  **Plan the File Creation:**
    *   Start with the essential theme configuration (`theme.yml`).
    *   Create the main layout file (`layout-full-width.tpl`).
    *   Create the core partials (`header.tpl`, `footer.tpl`, `notifications.tpl`).
    *   Create the homepage template (`index.tpl`).
    *   Create the CSS file (`custom.css` or `theme.css`) and JS file (`custom.js`).
    *   Populate these files with *adapted* code from the provided HTML/CSS/JS.

7.  **Adapt the Code (Mental Walkthrough & Snippet Generation):**

    *   **`theme.yml`:** Define theme name, version, author, compatibility, layouts, and assets. Critical for PrestaShop to recognize the theme.
    *   **`layout-*.tpl`:** Basic HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`). Include `{hook h='display...'}` calls for header, footer, notifications, and the main content block (`{$page.page_name}`, `{$layout}`). Link CSS/JS assets here.
    *   **`_partials/head.tpl` (Implicitly needed by layout):** Include meta tags, title (`{$page.meta.title}`), CSS links (`{$urls.theme_assets}`), font links, JS variables (`{js_custom_vars}`).
    *   **`_partials/header.tpl`:**
        *   Copy the `<header class="main-header">` structure.
        *   Use `{$urls.base_url}` for the logo link.
        *   Display the logo (`{$shop.logo}`).
        *   Replace the static nav (`<nav class="main-nav">`) with a hook for the main menu module (e.g., `{hook h='displayNavFullWidth'}` or `{hook h='displayTop'}`).
        *   Replace the static header icons with hooks for search (`{hook h='displaySearch'}`), user account (`{hook h='displayCustomerAccount'}`), and cart (`{hook h='displayShoppingCart'}`).
        *   Keep the mobile toggle button structure.
        *   Keep the `<nav class="mobile-nav">` structure but populate its links dynamically if possible (might require custom code or module override) or replicate the main menu links.
    *   **`_partials/footer.tpl`:**
        *   Copy the `<footer id="contact">` structure.
        *   Replace static content (About text, links, contact info) with hooks for relevant modules (`{hook h='displayFooter'}` which typically includes CMS links, contact info block, etc.) or use configuration values (`{$shop.name}`, `{$contact_infos.address.formatted}`).
        *   Keep the social icons structure, potentially making links configurable.
        *   Keep the payment methods section, potentially driven by active payment modules.
        *   Include JS assets links here if they should load last.
    *   **`index.tpl`:**
        *   Define the layout (`{extends file='layouts/layout-full-width.tpl'}`).
        *   Define the main content block (`{block name='content'}`).
        *   Copy the HTML structure for Hero, About, Scent Finder, Testimonials sections directly into this block *for now*.
        *   Replace the static "Featured Collections" section with a PrestaShop hook like `{hook h='displayHome'}`. This hook will render products using the `product.tpl` miniature template.
        *   *(Self-Correction):* The newsletter section is in the *HTML* `main`, but semantically and often practically, it belongs near or in the footer. Place the newsletter hook (`{hook h='displayFooterBefore'}`) *outside* the main content block, likely in the `layout-*.tpl` or directly in `footer.tpl`.
    *   **`assets/css/custom.css` (or `theme.css`):**
        *   Copy *all* content from `style.css`.
        *   *Crucially*, update image paths (e.g., background images) if they are theme assets, using relative paths like `../img/my-image.jpg`. Paths to product images will be handled dynamically by PrestaShop.
    *   **`assets/js/custom.js`:**
        *   Copy the JavaScript for the mobile menu toggle and sticky header.
        *   Ensure selectors (`.mobile-nav-toggle`, `.mobile-nav`, `.main-header`) match the generated HTML in the `.tpl` files. Wrap in a DOMContentLoaded listener or similar if necessary.

8.  **Refine and Add Detail:**
    *   Add comments explaining the purpose of different sections and hooks in the `.tpl` files.
    *   Mention the need to install modules (main menu, search bar, cart block, customer sign-in block, featured products, newsletter) and potentially configure them to appear in the correct hooks.
    *   Explain that hardcoded sections (About, Finder, Testimonials) on the homepage should ideally be replaced with CMS blocks or custom modules later for easier content management.
    *   Emphasize that this creates the *theme structure* and *initial homepage look*. Other pages (category, product, cart, checkout, account) will still need significant styling work by adapting the CSS and modifying their respective `.tpl` files to match the overall design.
    *   Include the Font Awesome link and Google Fonts link in `_partials/head.tpl`.
