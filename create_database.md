Okay, I understand. Based on the previous steps establishing that "The Scent" project is built using the **PrestaShop** e-commerce platform, the database schema is not something we design from scratch. PrestaShop comes with its own comprehensive and predefined MySQL database schema that handles all aspects of the e-commerce store.

Therefore, instead of designing a new schema, I will provide:
1.  A Markdown document (`complete_project_database_schema_design.md`) explaining that PrestaShop manages the schema and outlining the key areas of the *standard PrestaShop schema* relevant to the features discussed in "The Scent" design.
2.  An SQL script (`create_thescent_database.sql`) that performs the **necessary prerequisite step** before installing PrestaShop: creating an empty database and a dedicated user. The PrestaShop installer itself will then populate this database with its required tables.

Here are the files:

# Database Schema Design for The Scent PrestaShop Project

*Document Version: 1.0*
*Date: April 2025*

---

## 1. Introduction

This document addresses the database schema aspect of "The Scent" e-commerce project. As established in the project planning (`design_planning_steps.md`) and implementation details (`design_steps_detailed.md`), **this project utilizes the PrestaShop e-commerce platform (v1.7.x/8.x) built on an Apache/PHP/MySQL stack.**

A critical aspect of using a comprehensive platform like PrestaShop is that **it defines and manages its own extensive database schema**. This schema is designed to handle all the complexities of an online store, including products, categories, customers, orders, carts, content, configurations, and more.

Therefore, this document **does not define a new, custom database schema**. Instead, it provides an overview of the standard PrestaShop database architecture and highlights the key schema areas relevant to the features implemented and visualized in "The Scent" theme design (`improved landing page.html`, `style.css`, and theme `.tpl` files).

## 2. PrestaShop Database Architecture Overview

PrestaShop uses a relational MySQL database. Its schema is highly normalized, consisting of potentially hundreds of tables designed to store e-commerce data efficiently and flexibly.

*   **Table Prefixes:** PrestaShop tables typically use a prefix, commonly `ps_` by default, followed by the table name (e.g., `ps_product`, `ps_orders`). This prefix is configurable during installation.
*   **Multi-Store & Multi-Lang:** Many tables include `_shop` or `_lang` suffixes (e.g., `ps_product_lang`, `ps_category_shop`) to support multi-store and multi-language functionalities natively. `_lang` tables store translatable text fields, while `_shop` tables manage associations and settings specific to different shops in a multi-store setup.

## 3. Key Schema Areas Relevant to "The Scent" Theme

The custom theme "The Scent" interacts with data stored across various parts of the PrestaShop schema. Key areas include:

### 3.1 Catalog Management

These tables store all information about the products and categories displayed in the store, including the "Featured Collections" grid on the homepage and any future category/product pages.

*   **`ps_product`:** Core product data (reference, price, quantity, status, default category).
*   **`ps_product_lang`:** Translatable product details (name, description, short description, link rewrite/URL slug). Referenced in `product.tpl` miniature (`{$product.name}`, `{$product.description_short}`).
*   **`ps_category`:** Category hierarchy and status.
*   **`ps_category_lang`:** Translatable category details (name, description, link rewrite). Used for navigation menus and category pages.
*   **`ps_product_shop`, `ps_category_shop`:** Associations between products/categories and specific shops (in multi-store context).
*   **`ps_attribute`, `ps_attribute_group`, `ps_attribute_lang`:** Product attributes (e.g., Size, Color) used for variations/combinations.
*   **`ps_feature`, `ps_feature_value`, `ps_feature_lang`:** Product features (e.g., Ingredients, Benefits) used for displaying non-variant characteristics and filtering.
*   **`ps_product_attribute`, `ps_product_attribute_combination`:** Define product combinations (SKUs) based on attributes, managing stock, price variations, and specific images for each combination.
*   **`ps_image`, `ps_image_shop`, `ps_image_lang`:** Store product image information and associations. Referenced in `product.tpl` miniature (`{$product.cover...}`).

### 3.2 Customers, Carts, and Orders

These tables manage user accounts, shopping carts, and the entire order process, crucial for the e-commerce functionality.

*   **`ps_customer`:** Customer account information (name, email, password hash, registration date).
*   **`ps_address`:** Customer shipping and billing addresses.
*   **`ps_cart`:** Stores active shopping carts, linking customers, addresses, and products.
*   **`ps_cart_product`:** Details of products added to a specific cart.
*   **`ps_orders`:** Header information for completed orders (customer reference, addresses, payment method, shipping carrier, total amounts, status).
*   **`ps_order_detail`:** Line items for each order (products purchased, quantity, price).
*   **`ps_order_state`, `ps_order_state_lang`:** Defines the different statuses an order can have (e.g., Awaiting Payment, Processing, Shipped, Delivered).

### 3.3 Content Management (CMS)

These tables store static content like "About Us", "Privacy Policy", "Terms & Conditions" pages.

*   **`ps_cms`, `ps_cms_lang`, `ps_cms_shop`:** Stores the content, meta information, and URL slugs for individual CMS pages. Referenced via `{$link->getCMSLink(...)` in `.tpl` files (e.g., footer links, About section CTA).
*   **`ps_cms_category`, `ps_cms_category_lang`, `ps_cms_category_shop`:** Organizes CMS pages into categories if needed.

### 3.4 Theme, Modules, and Configuration

These tables store settings related to the shop's appearance, installed modules, and general configuration.

*   **`ps_configuration`:** A key-value store for global and module-specific settings.
*   **`ps_shop`, `ps_shop_url`:** Store information about the shop(s) including theme settings.
*   **`ps_theme`:** Information about installed themes. (Theme configuration itself is largely file-based in `theme.yml`).
*   **`ps_module`:** Lists installed modules.
*   **`ps_hook`, `ps_hook_module`:** Defines available hooks and which modules are attached to them, controlling dynamic content injection (e.g., `ps_featuredproducts` in `displayHome`).
*   **Module-Specific Tables:** Many modules (e.g., `ps_mainmenu`, `ps_linklist`, `ps_emailsubscription`) create their own tables to store their specific data (e.g., menu items, link block contents, subscriber emails).

### 3.5 Localization

Handles multi-language, multi-currency, and regional settings.

*   **`ps_lang`:** Defines available languages in the store.
*   **`ps_currency`:** Defines available currencies.
*   **`ps_country`, `ps_state`, `ps_zone`:** Defines geographical locations used for shipping and taxes.
*   **`ps_tax`, `ps_tax_rule`, `ps_tax_rules_group`:** Manages tax configurations.

## 4. Data Access by "The Scent" Theme

The custom theme (`.tpl` files) does **not** typically interact with the database directly via SQL queries. Instead, data access occurs through PrestaShop's architecture:

1.  **Controllers:** PrestaShop controllers fetch data from the database using Object Models (e.g., `Product`, `Category`, `Customer` classes) which abstract the database interactions.
2.  **Smarty Variables:** Controllers assign the retrieved data (often as objects or arrays) to Smarty variables (e.g., `{$product}`, `{$category}`, `{$products}`, `{$page}`, `{$shop}`, `{$customer}`). The theme templates (`.tpl`) then simply display this data using Smarty syntax.
3.  **Module Hooks:** Modules fetch their own data and render HTML content via hooks (`{hook h='...'}`). The theme provides the hook point, and PrestaShop calls the appropriate module(s) attached to that hook.

## 5. Schema Creation

The complete PrestaShop database schema (all the `ps_*` tables) is **created automatically by the PrestaShop web installer**. During installation, you provide the details of an **empty** MySQL database (database name, username, password). The installer then executes the necessary SQL scripts to create all required tables, indexes, relationships, and initial configuration data.

**Manual creation of the PrestaShop schema is not recommended or supported.**

## 6. Conclusion

The database schema for "The Scent" project is the standard, comprehensive schema provided and managed by the PrestaShop platform. The custom theme interacts with this underlying structure indirectly through PrestaShop's controllers, object models, Smarty template variables, and module hooks. Understanding the key areas of the PrestaShop schema (Catalog, Orders, Customers, CMS, Configuration) is helpful for theme development and debugging, but the theme itself does not define or alter this core schema. Schema creation is handled entirely by the PrestaShop installer when setting up the store on an empty database.

```sql
-- ======================================================================
-- SQL Script for The Scent PrestaShop Project - Database Creation
-- ======================================================================
--
-- IMPORTANT:
-- This script ONLY creates an EMPTY database and a dedicated user
-- with the necessary privileges for the PrestaShop installation.
--
-- DO NOT attempt to manually create the PrestaShop tables (`ps_*`) using this script.
-- The complete database schema will be created AUTOMATICALLY by the
-- PrestaShop web installer when you run it and provide these database details.
--
-- Instructions:
-- 1. Modify the database name ('thescent_db'), username ('thescent_user'),
--    and password ('YourSecurePassword!') below if desired.
-- 2. Run this script against your MySQL server using an administrator account
--    (e.g., root) BEFORE starting the PrestaShop installation process.
-- 3. Use the specified database name, username, and password during the
--    PrestaShop installation wizard.
--
-- ======================================================================

-- Create the database
-- Using utf8mb4 character set and utf8mb4_unicode_ci collation is recommended for PrestaShop
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS `thescent_db`
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

-- Create a dedicated user for the database
-- Replace 'YourSecurePassword!' with a strong, unique password
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS 'thescent_user'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'YourSecurePassword!';

-- Grant all privileges on the new database to the new user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `thescent_db`.* TO 'thescent_user'@'localhost';

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- ======================================================================
-- End of Script
-- Now you can proceed with the PrestaShop installation process.
