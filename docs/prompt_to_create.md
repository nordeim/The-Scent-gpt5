You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

now you will execute the task given in the attached task_specification.md

you can use the attached task_specification.md to help with your task planning

use the remaining attached files, design_steps_detailed.md, design_specification_document.md, 'improved landing page.html' and style.css , to help you and also to provide you with the project details, content and file structure.

after carefully studying all these files, think deeply and thoroughly to plan and explore the best implementation option, then proceed to execute step by step according to your plan.

great job so far. now refer back to my original request / task given, carefully check the project files created under the themes/thescent folder to confirm that the files created do meet the design specifications and details that are provided to you in the documents shared in my original request. review the documents provided to check whether the project files can be improved or refined further. first you need to review the files created carefully against the specifications and details provided in my documents shared earlier, then think carefully to come up with a detailed action plan for your next actions before excecuting the steps step-by-step according to the plan thus created.

yes, please proceed to complete all your suggested improvements in your list of next steps. remember to think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully for the best implementation option to implement your proposed changes, then come up with a detailed action plan before executing according to the plan thus created step-by-step cautiously.

you have done an awesome job so far! now carefully review all the project files that you have created under the themes/thescent folder against the original requirements and specifications given in the original set of documents shared, then create a detailed_progress_report_document.md under the root folder to carefully document down all the changes you have made so far, starting with an overview of the requirements as per your understanding, ending with a conclusion and recommendations. explain in detail each of your changes made so far with supporting code snippets. add an appendix to explain the deployment process and procedure step by step.

---
you have done an awesome job so far! now carefully review your design as specified in your newly created technical design specification document versus the originally shared design specifications and details documents, then create a complete MySQL database schema design for the newly created project in markdown format with file name "complete_project_database_schema_design.md" and also create a MySQL script to create such a database schema from scratch, create the script as file "create_thescent_database.sql".

first systematically review what we've accomplished against the specifications and identify gaps/improvements needed.

you can use the attached task_specification.md to help with your task planning

use the remaining attached files, design_steps_detailed.md, design_specification_document.md, 'improved landing page.html' and style.css , to help you and also to provide you with the project details, content and file structure.

after carefully studying all these files, compare them against the current project partially implemented in the themes/thescent subfolder (under project root folder) before thinking deeply and thoroughly to plan and explore the best implementation option, then proceed to execute step by step according to your plan.

please carefully review your changes and also review the current state of the project files in the themes/thescent folder and compare all these (current state) against the sample (improved) landing page design and the design specifications given in the design documents shared earlier, then think deeply and systematically to explore carefully the progress and changes made so far and document all these findings in a markdown format with filename "progress_update_document.md" under the project root folder. be very precise and detailed in documenting the details of progress and changes made so far.

please carefully and systematically review all the existing theme files under the themes/thescent folder against the original specifications and requirements to identify gaps/improvements needed. add any coding and logic errors as suggestions for improving in the progress_update_document.md file.

remember to think deeply and systematically via long chain of thoughts to thoroughly and carefully explore the best possible implementation option to implement your proposed changes, then come up with a detailed action plan before executing according to the plan thus created step-by-step cautiously.

Your task is spelled out in the attached task_specification.md file. After understanding your task, carefully review the attached design_planning_steps.md, design_steps_detailed.md and design_specification_document.md files to understand the specifications and requirements for this project. you are to create a custom PrestaShop theme that is based on the UI appearance of the sample landing page attached: 'improved landing page.html' and style.css.

Before planning your actions, carefully review all the current project files in the themes/thescent folder to understand the current state of this project. then compare your understanding of the current project state (from the review of the actual files) against the checkpoint documents produced by the previous build run: current_landing_page.html, progress_update_document.md and current_design_specification_document.md files.

With a complete understanding of the project requirements and the given specifications, as well as a complete understanding of the current state of the project (based on the actual project files under the themes/thescent folder), think deeply and systematically to explore thoroughly for the best implementation option to complete your task. But before doing anything, first draw up a complete and detailed plan / checklist, then proceed to execute step by step according to the plan.
