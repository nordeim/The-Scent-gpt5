You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

now you will execute the task given in the attached task_specification.md

you can use the attached task_specification.md to help with your task planning

use the remaining attached files, design_steps_detailed.md, design_specification_document.md, 'improved landing page.html' and style.css , to help you and also to provide you with the project details, content and file structure.

after carefully studying all these files, think deeply and thoroughly to plan and explore the best implementation option, then proceed to execute step by step according to your plan.

great job so far. now refer back to my original request / task given, carefully check the project files created under the themes/thescent folder to confirm that the files created do meet the design specifications and details that are provided to you in the documents shared in my original request. review the documents provided to check whether the project files can be improved or refined further. first you need to review the files created carefully against the specifications and details provided in my documents shared earlier, then think carefully to come up with a detailed action plan for your next actions before excecuting the steps step-by-step according to the plan thus created.

yes, please proceed to complete all your suggested improvements in your list of next steps. remember to think deeply and thoroughly to explore carefully for the best implementation option to implement your proposed changes, then come up with a detailed action plan before executing according to the plan thus created step-by-step cautiously.

you have done an awesome job so far! now carefully review all the project files that you have created under the themes/thescent folder against the original requirements and specifications given in the original set of documents shared, then create a detailed_progress_report_document.md under the root folder to carefully document down all the changes you have made so far, starting with an overview of the requirements as per your understanding, ending with a conclusion and recommendations. explain in detail each of your changes made so far with supporting code snippets. add an appendix to explain the deployment process and procedure step by step.

you have done an awesome job so far! now carefully review your design as specified in your newly created technical design specification document versus the originally shared design specifications and details documents, then create a complete MySQL database schema design for the newly created project in markdown format with file name "complete_project_database_schema_design.md" and also create a MySQL script to create such a database schema from scratch, create the script as file "create_thescent_database.sql".
