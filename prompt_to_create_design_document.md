You are a deep-thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution before answering. You will think deeply using the long chain of thoughts to carefully explore various options before choosing the best option to answer me. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

Now carefully study the requirements specified in the attached design_planning_steps.md file, then create for me a design specification document in markdown format using the attached sample_design_specification_document.md as your reference / template. you have to use the remaining files, design_steps_detailed.md, 'improved landing page.html' and style.css, as the actual project data and information. remember to think carefully and explore with extensive web searches if necessary, to create the correct design_specification_document.md based on the details in design_steps_detailed.md, 'improved landing page.html' and style.css files.

Your task is to create a Technical Design Specification document in Markdown format for the "The Scent" PrestaShop theme. This document (design_specification_document.md) needs to be based on the information provided in the following files:
1.  `style.css`: The visual styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations.
2.  `improved landing page.html`: The structure and content of the homepage design concept.
3.  `design_planning_steps.md`: High-level project plan, tech stack (Apache/PHP/MySQL), platform choice (PrestaShop), and requirements.
4.  `design_steps_detailed.md`: Detailed PrestaShop theme structure (`themes/thescent/`), core `.tpl` files, `theme.yml`, JS/CSS integration specifics, and adapted code snippets.
5.  `sample_design_specification_document.md`: The template/reference for structure, tone, and content type.

Use the following process to proceed:
1.  **Understand the Goal & Inputs:** Clearly define what needs to be produced using the provided materials.
2.  **Analyze the Template:** Break down the `sample_design_specification_document.md` into sections to understand the required content for each.
3.  **Extract & Synthesize Information:** Go through each section of the template and gather the corresponding information from the `style.css`, `.html`, and `design_*.md` files. This involves mapping the static HTML/CSS design to the PrestaShop theme implementation details provided in `design_steps_detailed.md`.
4.  **Adapt Code Snippets:** Select and adapt relevant code snippets (HTML/TPL, CSS, JS, YAML) from the provided files to illustrate points within the specification document, mirroring the style of the sample document. Snippets should be concise and relevant to the section.
5.  **Structure the Document:** Organize the synthesized information and code snippets according to the template's structure using Markdown.
6.  **Refine Content & Tone:** Ensure the language is technical, descriptive, and accurate. Maintain consistency and flow. Fill in any logical gaps based on standard web development/PrestaShop practices where the source material is silent (e.g., basic accessibility considerations, testing types).
7.  **Validate:** Review the generated document against the requirements and the source files to ensure all key aspects are covered accurately and follow the template's format.

    *   **Responsive Design:** Summarize the `@media` queries from `style.css` (992px, 576px). Explain key changes: hiding desktop nav/showing toggle, stacking grid columns (about, products, footer), adjusting font sizes/padding. Include example media query snippets.
    *   **Performance & Accessibility:**
        *   **Performance:** Mention standard PrestaShop performance features (caching, CCC from `design_planning_steps.md`), potential for image optimization (`home_default` size defined), use of efficient CSS (transitions/transforms). Need to *infer* standard practices like minification for production.
        *   **Accessibility:** Mention use of semantic HTML (`header`, `nav`, `main`, `footer`, `section` from `.tpl` files), potential need to check color contrast (e.g., gold on white might need checks), planned use of ARIA attributes (`aria-label` already in HTML/TPL examples), keyboard navigation (default browser/PrestaShop behavior, needs testing), visible focus states (needs explicit styling, add a note about this).
    *   **Testing, Maintenance, Future Enhancements:**
        *   **Testing:** Mention cross-browser, responsive testing (standard practice). Add testing PrestaShop functionality (checkout, cart, modules).
        *   **Maintenance:** Mention version control (standard practice), PrestaShop updates (`design_planning_steps.md`), module updates.
        *   **Future Enhancements:** Replacing hardcoded sections (About, Finder, Testimonials) with modules/CMS blocks, developing a real "Scent Quiz" tool, adding more sophisticated animations, further performance optimization, PWA potential.
    *   **Conclusion:** Summarize the key achievements of the theme design: integrating the visual design into PrestaShop, establishing the brand's aesthetic (elegant, natural), providing core e-commerce layouts (header, footer, product grid), and setting the foundation for a functional store. Reiterate the tech stack (PrestaShop, Smarty, CSS variables, JS).

5.  **Refine and Format:**
    *   Ensure the language is technical and descriptive, matching the tone of the sample document.
    *   Use Markdown formatting correctly (headings, code blocks, lists).
    *   Embed relevant, *concise* code snippets (HTML/TPL, CSS, JS, YAML) directly within the document sections as done in the sample. Make sure snippets are correctly adapted from the input files to illustrate the points being made.
    *   Double-check that all aspects mentioned in the input files (especially `design_steps_detailed.md`) are covered.
    *   Ensure consistency in terminology (e.g., "The Scent," "PrestaShop theme").
    *   Review for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Make sure the document flows logically from high-level concepts to specific implementation details. *Self-correction: Initially, I might just copy large chunks of code. Need to trim snippets to be illustrative examples.* *Self-correction: Ensure the HTML snippets reflect the Smarty `.tpl` structure where appropriate, not just the raw `improved landing page.html`.*

6.  **Final Output Generation:** Assemble the refined sections into the final Markdown document.
